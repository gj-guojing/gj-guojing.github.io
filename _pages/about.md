I am currently a Research Assistant at the Intelligent Robot & Control Lab, **Southern University of Science and Technology (SUSTech)**, supervised by [Prof. Yang Pan](https://faculty.sustech.edu.cn/pany/en/) and collaborating closely with [Prof. Jian S. Dai](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=PXpHh2UAAAAJ&hl=en).

My research lies at the intersection of **Control Theory** and **Robot Learning**, with a primary goal of enhancing the agility of legged locomotion and the dexterity of robotic manipulation. I am particularly interested in leveraging **Model Predictive Control (MPC)** and **Reinforcement Learning (RL)** to solve complex dynamic tasks.

Currently, I am a core member of the **"Nanke Pangu" Humanoid Robot Project**, developing learning-based manipulation strategies that integrate impedance control and teleoperation. Previously, I led the design and control of **STANDER**, a self-built underactuated balancing robot. For this platform, I proposed a novel **Model Predictive Balance Controller (MPBC)**, and co-developed an **RL** controller to achieve zero-shot Sim-to-Real transfer.

Before returning to academia, I gained extensive industrial experience in **robotics and automation**, most notably as a Software Engineer at **Bosch Rexroth** (international R&D team), where I developed core motion control modules for next-generation industrial controllers.

I received my M.Sc. in Electronic Science and Technology from SUSTech and my B.Sc. in Mechatronics Engineering from Southwest Petroleum University.
