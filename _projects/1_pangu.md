As a core member of **"Nanke Pangu"** project (Shenzhen's first university-developed humanoid robot, led by Prof. Jian S. Dai), I am developing advanced control strategies for **bimanual manipulation**.

**Methodology:** Leveraging **Conformal Geometric Algebra (CGA)** based similarity task spaces and **Diffusion Models** to reconstruct **Simulated Zero-Force Trajectories (sZFT)**.

**Goal:** To enable contact-rich and dexterous manipulation for collaborative tasks.
