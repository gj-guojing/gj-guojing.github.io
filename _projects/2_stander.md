**Platform:** Led by complete **mechatronic design and fabrication** of robot, integrating EtherCAT real-time communication.

**MPC:** Led by design of a novel **Model Predictive Balance Controller**, validated by reformulating nonlinear dynamics into an efficient representation for real-time QP optimization.

**RL:** Co-developed a **Reinforcement Learning** controller that achieved **zero-shot Sim-to-Real transfer** by integrating identified motor friction parameters.
